/*
Explanation of changes:
1.  `import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';` and `admin.initializeApp();`:
    * These lines are absolutely critical for your Cloud Functions to interact with other Firebase services like Firestore. The `submitQuiz` function needs `admin.firestore()` to save quiz attempts. This initialization should happen once in your main entry point (`index.ts`).
2.  `import { submitQuiz } from "./submitQuiz.js";`:
    * This line imports the `submitQuiz` function from its separate file. This tells TypeScript (and the Firebase CLI) that `submitQuiz` is part of your project's functions.
    * We are using `.js` extension for explicit module resolution, especially when dealing with CommonJS output from TypeScript and Firebase's bundling process. While `tsc` often handles this implicitly, explicit `.js` can prevent subtle runtime issues.
3.  `export { submitQuiz };`:
    * This line explicitly exports `submitQuiz` from `index.ts`. **This is the primary reason your function wasn't being detected and deployed.** Firebase CLI scans this entry file (`index.ts` as specified in `package.json`'s `main` field) for exported functions. If it's not exported here, Firebase won't know to deploy it.

You will also need a `functions/src/submitQuiz.ts` file with the logic for `submitQuiz`, which we discussed in previous responses. Make sure that file exists and contains the `export const submitQuiz = functions.region('us-central1').https.onCall(...)` definition.
